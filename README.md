# DigHum-100-Project
This is my project for DigHum 100 (Theory & Methods in the Digital Humanities) @ UC Berkeley in summer 2021 taught by Prof. Adam Anderson.
The goal of this project is to analyze BTS, given certain datasets about their music.<br/><br/>

The dataframe `lyrics` contains 226 observations of BTS tracks and includes `album_title`, `track_title`, `lang` (the language of the song) and, most importantly, `lyrics` as features. This dataframe is provided by Kaggle user **kaili** who scraped this data from https://genius.com/  under a **CC0: Public Domain License**.
<br/><br/>

The dataframe `spotify` is also a Kaggle dataset by user **Yamac Eren Ay** who, by using the Spotify API, has scraped data from about around 600,000 tracks published on Spotify under **Community Data License Agreement â€“ Sharing, Version 1.0**. 
<br/><br/>

*Note that the "full" dataset has over 15 million tracks and includes data about specific artists, but is over 3GB in storage.* 
<br/><br/>

This dataset provides information on easily gathered features such as `popularity` and `duration_ms`, but also Spotify measures their own audio features such as `danceability`, `energy`, `key`, `loudness`, `mode` and much more. 
The full description of these features can be found at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-tracks under AudioFeaturesObject.

The notebook includes my original code and process cleaning, organizing, merging, quality-checking, and finally, analyzing the dataset through multiple different methods.
